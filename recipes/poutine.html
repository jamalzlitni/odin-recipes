    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 large Yukon gold potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for frying</li>
        <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
        <li>1 small clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole green peppercorns</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups cheddar cheese curds</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the potatoes lengthwise, about 1/4 inch thick. Stack 
            the slices and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick sticks 
            (or cut the potatoes into fries using a french fry cutter). 
            Place in a large bowl filled with cold water and let sit 
            at least 1 hour, or up to 24 hours for extra-crispy fries. 
            Drain well and pat dry or spin dry in a salad spinner.</li>
        <li>Make the gravy: Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a saucepan 
            over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and saute until 
            translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken and beef stock, 
            ketchup, vinegar, peppercorns and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. 
            Add the flour and make a roux, stirring until slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Whisk the stock mixture into the roux and simmer until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. 
            Season the gravy with salt and pepper and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels. 
            Heat 2 to 3 inches vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over 
            medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 
            350 degrees F (or use a deep fryer). Fry the potatoes in 
            small batches until whitish yellow, about 8 minutes. 
            Remove with a strainer and drain on the paper towels. 
            Bring the oil temperature to 375 degrees F over high heat. 
            Fry the potatoes in batches again until golden brown, 
            6 to 8 minutes. Drain on fresh paper towels. 
            Salt and pepper the fries while hot. Strain the gravy.</li>
        <li>Put the fries in shallow dishes; top with the cheese curds and gravy.</li>
    </ol>
