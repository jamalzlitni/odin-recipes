# odin-recipes
My first real project on the course!
This project won't look very nice until I learn and implement CSS, but it will put many of the concepts I've been learning into one project. These concepts include but are not limited to: links, different pages, file organization, bolding/italics if needed, headers, and ordered/unordered lists.
